DESIGN / UI REWORK REQUEST (Expo React Native + Web)
====================================================

Project: ContainerFlow (waste container logistics app)
Platforms: iOS + Android (Expo) and Web
Roles: ADMIN + DRIVER
Core screens: Login, Task List, Task Detail, Scan (QR), Containers (Warehouse/Customer), Container Detail, Admin Dashboard, Activity History, Forms (Create Task, Assign Driver), etc.

GOAL
====

I want you to do a full professional UI/UX pass across the entire app:

1) Fix all spacing, typography, alignment, and layout consistency.
2) Make Light Mode and Dark Mode BOTH look excellent and fully consistent.
3) Ensure in Dark Mode no screen looks “light” or has white backgrounds unless explicitly intended for small cards.
4) Ensure all buttons, inputs, and text are readable and pass accessibility contrast.
5) Ensure responsive layouts so it looks correct on ALL phones (small iPhone, large iPhone, small Android, large Android) and on web.
6) Produce a coherent design system (colors, typography scale, spacing scale, radii, shadows/elevation, borders) that matches the app context (logistics, industrial, clean, professional).

IMPORTANT: Keep business logic unchanged. This is purely design + UI/UX + theming work.
Do not remove features, only improve visuals and consistency.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART A — DESIGN SYSTEM (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Create/Refine a central design system in the existing theme file:
- Use the existing design system location (e.g. client/constants/theme.ts or similar).
- Define tokens for:
  - Colors (light and dark palettes)
  - Typography scale (sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Spacing scale (4/8/12/16/20/24/32 etc.)
  - Border radius scale (8/12/16/20)
  - Shadows/elevation for iOS/Android and subtle web shadows
  - Standard border color per mode
  - Standard disabled, pressed, and focus states

2) Choose a professional color palette appropriate for logistics:
- Neutral background + strong accent color
- Good “status colors” for task statuses (planned, accepted, in progress, completed, cancelled)
- Keep it consistent across app
- Ensure dark palette is truly dark, not washed out

Example direction (you may refine):
- Accent: deep blue or teal (trust, professional)
- Success: green
- Warning: amber
- Error: red
- Info: blue
- Neutrals: slate/graphite in dark mode, light gray in light mode

3) Make sure text contrast is correct:
- Dark buttons must have light text
- Light buttons must have dark text
- Primary buttons must always be readable
- Use at least WCAG AA contrast where feasible

4) Add “status badges” mapping:
- TaskStatus → background + text color + border
- Keep consistent in both modes

Deliverable: theme tokens + status color mapping + usage guidelines (as inline comments).

------------------------------------------------------------
PART B — GLOBAL DARK/LIGHT MODE CONSISTENCY
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Audit every screen and component:
- Make sure backgrounds use theme background colors:
  - Light mode: light surface & background
  - Dark mode: dark background and dark surfaces
- Ensure there are no hardcoded colors:
  - Remove any `#fff`, `white`, `black`, `gray`, etc. unless they come from theme tokens.
- Ensure every screen uses the same base background in each mode.

2) Fix the issue where in Dark Mode some pages still look light:
- Identify which components/screens are forcing white backgrounds or incorrect theme usage.
- Replace with theme tokens.

3) Ensure the navigation (tab bar, headers, stacks) match the theme:
- Tab bar background and border
- Header background, title colors, back button color
- Status bar style changes per mode (light-content / dark-content)

------------------------------------------------------------
PART C — LAYOUT, SPACING, AND RESPONSIVENESS (ALL DEVICES)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Make a consistent layout grid:
- Standard screen padding (e.g. 16)
- Standard vertical spacing between sections (e.g. 12/16/24)
- Consistent card padding (e.g. 12/16)
- Align lists, cards, buttons, inputs properly

2) Ensure responsiveness:
- Use safe area insets (SafeAreaView / useSafeAreaInsets)
- Avoid fixed widths/heights that break on small phones
- Use flex layouts and wrapping
- Ensure long text truncation and proper line breaks
- Make buttons full width where appropriate, with min height 44–48
- Ensure list items and cards adapt gracefully
- Ensure web layout is not cramped:
  - add max width container on large screens
  - center content with a reasonable max width (e.g. 900–1200)
  - keep mobile-first design

3) Typography:
- Establish consistent heading styles:
  - Screen title
  - Section title
  - Item title
  - Meta text
- Ensure readable line heights
- Ensure “small text” is not too small on phones

------------------------------------------------------------
PART D — COMPONENT QUALITY (BUTTONS, INPUTS, CARDS, TOASTS)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Buttons:
- Primary / Secondary / Tertiary / Destructive variants
- Disabled states
- Loading states (spinner aligned)
- Pressed state feedback (opacity / subtle scale)
- Always correct text contrast

2) Inputs:
- Consistent text color and placeholder color per mode
- Focus state (border color)
- Error state (border + helper text)
- Keyboard handling (KeyboardAvoidingView where needed)

3) Cards & Lists:
- Consistent card style:
  - border radius, surface color, border color
  - subtle shadow/elevation
- Lists with separators consistent per mode

4) Modals / Bottom sheets:
- The scan result popup/modal should be visually polished:
  - card style
  - clear hierarchy
  - consistent actions
  - proper padding and spacing
- Use subtle animations (Reanimated already available) but keep it smooth and not distracting

5) Toasts / snackbars:
- Ensure success/error messages are consistent and readable
- Do not use default alerts unless necessary

------------------------------------------------------------
PART E — SCREEN-BY-SCREEN POLISH
------------------------------------------------------------

Please review and polish at least these screens:

- Login / Auth screens
- Driver Task List
- Driver Task Detail
- Scan Screen (camera view + overlay + result modal)
- Containers list (warehouse/customer)
- Container detail screen (including “Container leeren” button)
- Admin Dashboard + stats tiles
- Admin Task List (all open tasks) + task detail
- Activity History screen
- Forms: Create Task / Assign Driver

For each screen:
- Ensure correct background in both modes
- Ensure spacing is consistent
- Ensure components use the design system
- Ensure status badges are consistent
- Ensure empty states (no tasks, no containers) look good

------------------------------------------------------------
PART F — “NO HARD-CODED COLORS” RULE
------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL RULE:
- Replace hard-coded colors with theme tokens.
- If a component currently uses inline hardcoded colors, refactor it to consume theme variables.
- Ensure all icons use theme colors.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART G — ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (WHAT I WILL CHECK)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) In Dark Mode:
- No screen appears “light” or with white page background
- Text and buttons have excellent contrast
- Tab bar and headers match the dark theme

2) In Light Mode:
- Clean, modern look
- Comfortable spacing
- No overly harsh contrast

3) Responsiveness:
- Looks correct on small and large phones
- No overlapping text, no cut-off buttons
- Smooth and consistent across web too

4) Consistency:
- Same padding, same card style, same typography
- Same button variants used everywhere
- Same status colors used everywhere

------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------

- Keep all existing navigation and logic.
- Only change UI/UX: styles, layout, component design, theme usage.
- Refactor components to use a consistent set of shared UI components if needed (e.g. ThemedView, ThemedText, Button).
- Ensure nothing breaks for Expo Go on iOS/Android.

DELIVERABLE
===========

After completing the changes:
- The app has a cohesive design system
- All screens match the design system
- Dark mode is fully correct and consistently dark
- Light mode is consistent and clean
- UI is responsive and professional everywhere
